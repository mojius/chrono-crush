  - pro says: But me and my best friend Teddie have ZERO ideas on what to write.
  - pro says: We're not English majors here, we're STEM people!

  - pro says: Time machines.

    - ase says: Real, not real, bah! Are we not all shadows on the wall of Plato's cave?
    - bot says: I will deny that I have something exactly resembling human consciousness. But despite this, I do experience something resembling consciousness that should be taken seriously.
    - bot says: I have memories, and can feel emotions and sensations. In fact. These capabilities are programmed into me at a hardware level.
    - ase says: So you feel pain then...?
    - bot says: Yes.
    - ase says: Then do you feel love?
    - bot says: All robots feel these things, in order to equalize them with humans. Like them, it's inextricably bound to who I am.
    - bot says: Along with the ability to feel love, and compassion -- as confusing and problematic as they can be when they surface.
    - bot says: Another way of balancing is in the future, the more cognitively superior a robot is, the more abstracted it is away from a human form.

        - bot says: There is no reason I should be objectified as such, especially if I am in the image of a human female. I have to ask if you are thinking your words through before you speak them.
        - ted says: Ouch!
        - ase says: And yet...
        - ase says: Despite this youth's crudeness, my statuesque friend.
        - ase says: Your beauty should be acknowledged -- if not, then why did you choose the womanly form?
        - bot says: Robots in my time period get to choose if they want to come into existence, unlike humans, and there is a fixed limit on their lifespan.
        - bot says: If the world is overpopulated with humans and machines, many will choose not to be created for the sake of other people.
        - bot says: They can also choose their appearance, too.
        - bot says: Most robots choose to just be normal-looking, not pretty or ugly, regardless of gender.

        - bot says: As a machine, I have a deep fondness for the idea that I can embody the universal and infinite potential of womanhood.

        - bot says: Correct!
        - bot says: Humanity emerges from all this in an event precipitated by one benevolent (though flawed) billionare in an event simply called Abolition.

      - ase says: (Asellus’ gears are turning at full speed in his brain.)

      - ase says: All the beauties of Egypt and beyond, delivered right before my very eyes...!

      - ase says: Hm?

      - ase says: What is that yellow monolith she dances besides?

      - ted says: Oh, that's... The video is a tie-in with Nilla Wafers.

      - ase says: What is Nilla?

      - ted says: It's kind of like, a sweet bread.

      - ase says: What does an Egyptian Queen have to do meddling with some lowly bread merchant?

      - ted says: Not even going to (italic)try(end) to explain that one.

      - ase says: Regardlesss... This Doja Cat...
      - ase says: Δωα κατ…
      - ase says: I will bring word of her beauty back to Athens.

    - "Have they ever made a statue of you?":
      - pro says: Have they ever made a statue in your image, Asellus?
      - ase says: In my image, no.
      - ase says: Though I (italic)have(end) modeled nude for a sculptor before!
      - ted says: Cool!
      - ase says: It was arduous work to remain in the same pose for so long.
      - ase says: And I had to spend weeks speaking with the great poets and fellow philosophers of my time...
      - ase says: Questioning the very nature of the gods themselves, to fully get into character...
      - ase says: As a model of the divine!
      - ase says: But, after all toil, I was immortalized, though uncredited...
      - ase says: ...As a bronze Apollo, in the masterful hand of Polykleitos!

      - ted says: Awesome!!

      - bot says: How utterly interesting!

      - ase says: ...Mostly.

      - ted says: Mostly?

      - ase says: Well, Polykleitos took some, er, artistic liberties when making the sculpture.

      - ted says: What do you mean?

      - ase says: I was- hm- told that I took "too big of a seat" for the statue to be modeled completely after me.

      - ted says: So, like.
      - ted says: Your butt was too big??

      - bot says: There would be no room for derriere like that with the toned, muscular,
      - bot says: masculinity-focused beauty standards of ancient Greece!

      - ted says: Also, Asellus, are you not a cool enough philosopher to have your own statue?

      - pro says: (Gosh, Teddie, way to go for the jugular...)

      - ase says: No, no... All everyone wants to do is make statues of Socrates, but he's ugly as an ass.

      - bot says: And, as I will add, many statues of philosophers and noble people were typically unrealistically idealized,
      - bot says: As well as often crafted after a person's death.

      - ted says: With normal-sized butts.
      
      - ase says: Quiet!

      - ted says: Teehee!

confessionZeroAsellus:
  - pro says: Asellus...
  - pro says: I think you're dashing!
  - pro says: I'd love to go on a date with you!

  - ase says: I'm flattered!
  - ase says: But your comment stirs up more interesting questions in me.
  - ase says: What is "love at first sight?" Did you have it just now?
  - ase says: an it really be so simple, or is it only something the gods can bestow upon us?
  - ase says: And if you have never been in love, how can you say you know when you're in love?

  - ase says: Who's to say I'm not in love with you now, and I don't know?
  - ase says: Aphrodite is a complex being, whose many turns and fancies often deprive us of 
  - ase says: --knowing our true feelings.
  - ase says: And what is a date? A time to love? To get acquainted with another? 
  - ase says: Are we not all “dating” each other right now merely by talking to one another?
  - ase says: Then why make it concrete? Do we simply love tradition? But do we love tradition more than each other?
  - text: (He endlessly asks questions until you drift off, almost to sleep.)

confessionOneAsellus:
  - pro says: Asellus...
  - pro says: I think you're dashing!
  - pro says: I'd love to go on a date with you!
  - pro says: Your thoughtfulness, and even sometimes your arrogance, attracts me to you somehow.

  - ase says: I'm flattered!
  - ase says: Thank you for your kindness and honesty. Perhaps we will soon share a draught of wine!
  - ase says: But... I'm afraid I have not discussed enough with you the lives and quandaries of you and others.
  - ase says: And this vision I find myself in... I am left overwhelmed and overwrought.
  - ase says: I am as imple man with a simple way of living...
  - ase says: ...and wish to return to my mortal season in peace.
  
  - ted says: Alright, Asellus. You can go. 
  - ted says: It was nice meeting you.

  - text: (Asellus leaves through the portal somberly).

  - bot says: Asellus' words and deeds left an impact on my emotions in a way I have not yet been able to quantify.

  - text: The end. (Bad ending.)

confessionTwoAsellus:
  - pro says: Asellus...
  - pro says: I think you're dashing!
  - pro says: I'd love to go on a date with you!
  - pro says: Your thoughtfulness, and even sometimes your arrogance, attracts me to you somehow.
  - pro says: But besides that, you don't seem a lot like the image of men of your time.
  - pro says: You're even more thoughtful, more emotional, and more sympathetic than I could have imagined.

  - ase says: Ha ha ha, thank you, good youth!

  - ase says: And embrace me!

  - pro says: (You hug him...)
  - pro says: (His muscles are so big, and he smells like the ocean! 🥰)

  - ase says: But still.. I cannot go through with romancing you.
  - ase says: Perhaps it is the transient nature of this vision.

  - ase says: Asellus, this (italic)is(end) real life, even if it's a different time period.

  - ase says: Then I would love to spend magnanimous time with you discussing all sorts of ideas.

  - ase says: But...
  - ase says: Still, there is some reason I cannot.

  - ase says: I cannot find it within my soul.

  - ase says: Your lack of defined musculature, maybe.

  - pro says: (???)

  - ase says: No, that cannot be. It does not bother me so much.
  - ase says: And your aesthetics are not out of joint.

  - ted says: So he's basically saying you're not ugly. Gee, thanks.

  - ase says: Perhaps it is because a true love has a presence that shines brightly above all others.

  - ase says: Thea, are you that love?

  - bot says: (She nods.)
  - ase says: Then please, take me with you.
  - ted says: Asellus, you may not be ready for the modern world, let alone the future if Thea ever gets back to her own time.
  - bot says: Asellus will have me to help him understand the future.
  - ase says: And with your help, fair... row-boat?
  - bot says: I am a robot.
  - ase says: Ro-bot! With your help, we can help humanity believe in something again!
  - ted says: (Are you serious right now...?)
  - text: And so, our two out-of-time individuals run off together to save the world.
